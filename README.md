2. The admin email for the project
3. The staging IP
4. The production IP

for example
	./trellis_bedrock_sage_provision.sh bloglyfe hola@bloglyfe.com 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0

Et voila! Hit enter and wait for Gulp and Browsersync to launch your new app in your default browser.

To-do's:

1. Add flags to prevent the provisioning/deployment of staging, and/or production servers
